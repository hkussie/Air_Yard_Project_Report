	<h1 id="header">The Target Share Metric: Why It's Crucial</h1>
	<p id="lowertext">A further look at the Target Share metric and how it will change the way you look at receiver productivity.</p>

<h3 id="header">Why Not Simply Look At the Target Metric?</h3>
<p id="lowertext">It would seem, at initial glance, that looking at the target metric would be the most straightforward and effective way to judge how productive a receiver will be. This however fails to take into account how the receiver performs once he has been targeted and how productive he is relative to other receivers on his respective team. Let's take a look at the relationship between the receiver's target share and the number of receptions that that receiver had on average. In addition, we'll take a look at the top 25 most productive receivers with regards to number of receptions (which will become relevant later on): </p>

<p id="lowertext">As we can see, there exists a fairly strong correlation between a receiver's target share and the number of receptions that the receiver obtains and the predicted values continue to increase based off of the linear regression. This however is to be expected, as the number of receptions a receiver will have is a core variable when calculating a receiver's target share. </p>

<h3 id="header">How Target Share Impacts Other Metrics...</h3>
<p id="lowertext">Since we know that target share correlates well with the number of receptions a receiver will have, let's see how the target share metric impacts a number of other desirable metrics: </p>

<h3 id="header">What Does the Data Say?</h3>
<p id="lowertext">Looking at the charts we see there exists fairly strong correlations between target share, yeceiving yards and yards after catch. Furthermore, when we look at the 25 most productive receivers in each metric, we see plenty of overlap when we take into account target share. Put bluntly, the most productive receivers will have a disproportionate target share score relative to other receivers throughout the league.</p>

<h3 id="header">The Final Take Away</h3>
<p id="lowertext">When looking for productive receivers, you should be looking at the target share metric. A high target share metric percentage will typically yield more receiving yards, receptions, and yards after catch. Which will ultimately lead to more fantasy points.</p>
